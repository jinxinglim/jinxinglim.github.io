This is a joint work from the Formal Verification in Blockchain reading group, which consists of [Barnab√© Monnot](https://barnabemonnot.com/), [Zhangsheng Lai](https://zunction.github.io/) and myself.    

In this post, we will be understanding and covering the important definitions and results regarding the safety properties (more on this later) from the Coq code presented in the paper, [Formalizing Correct-by-Construction Casper in Coq](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343704844_Formalizing_Correct-by-Construction_Casper_in_Coq), by authors from [Runtime Verification Inc](https://runtimeverification.com/).
The Coq code can be found in [here](https://runtimeverification.github.io/casper-cbc-proof-docs/docs/latest/alectryon/toc.html). 
We will also be referencing from the paper, [Introducing the "Minimal CBC Casper" Family of Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf), by authors from [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/) as the code covers the formalized version of the definitions and results in the paper as well.
The code presented in this post is mostly from `Protocol.v`, unless otherwise stated, as most of the definitions and results regarding the safety properties of the CBC Casper protocol are covered in this file.
We will be mapping from the formalized definitions and results found in `Protocol.v`, unless otherwise stated, to the corresponding definitions and results in either [Formalizing Correct-by-Construction Casper in Coq](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343704844_Formalizing_Correct-by-Construction_Casper_in_Coq) or [Introducing the "Minimal CBC Casper" Family of Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf), or vice versa.
We will provide necessary details for each of the mappings to provide a better understanding for the readers but will not be covering most of the proofs presented.
Interested readers can either run through the Alectryon proof movies in [here](https://runtimeverification.github.io/casper-cbc-proof-docs/docs/latest/alectryon/toc.html) or read the [post](https://zunction.github.io/blog/2021/safety-proofs/) by Zhangsheng Lai, where he covers the formalized proofs of the 5 main theorems from [Introducing the "Minimal CBC Casper" Family of Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf).

### Correct-by-Construction (CBC) Casper

**Consensus protocols** can be thought of as "rules" used by nodes in a distributed network to make consistent decisions, i.e., come to consensus, from possibly inconsistent alternative decisions from different nodes. We defined the set of decisions as **consensus values**, $\mathcal{C}$. For example, in a binary consensus protocol, where
