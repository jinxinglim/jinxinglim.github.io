This is a joint work with [Barnab√© Monnot](https://barnabemonnot.com/) and [Zhangsheng Lai](https://zunction.github.io/).    

In this post, we will be understanding the Coq code presented in the paper, [Formalizing Correct-by-Construction Casper in Coq](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343704844_Formalizing_Correct-by-Construction_Casper_in_Coq), by authors from [Runtime Verification Inc](https://runtimeverification.com/).
The Coq code can be found in (https://runtimeverification.github.io/casper-cbc-proof-docs/docs/latest/alectryon/toc.html). 
We will also be referencing from the paper, [Introducing the "Minimal CBC Casper" Family of Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf), by authors from [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/) as the code covers the formalized version of the definitions and results in the paper as well.
The code presented in this post is from `Protocol.v`, unless otherwise stated, as most of the important definitions and results are covered in this file.
We will be mapping from the formalized definitions and results found in `Protocol.v`, unless otherwise stated, to the corresponding definitions and results in either [Formalizing Correct-by-Construction Casper in Coq](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343704844_Formalizing_Correct-by-Construction_Casper_in_Coq) or [Introducing the "Minimal CBC Casper" Family of Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf).
We will leave remarks for each of the mappings to provide a better understanding for the readers but will not be covering most of the proofs presented.
Interested readers can either run through the Alectryon proof movies in (https://runtimeverification.github.io/casper-cbc-proof-docs/docs/latest/alectryon/toc.html) or read the [post](https://zunction.github.io/blog/2021/safety-proofs/) by Zhangsheng Lai, where he covers the formalized proofs of the 5 main theorems from [Introducing the "Minimal CBC Casper" Family of Consensus Protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf).
