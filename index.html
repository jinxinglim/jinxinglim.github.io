			Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)</a>.
			My research interests lie at application of mathematics on artificial intelligence and blockchain, or vice versa.
			I am currently working on blockchain application of theorem proving. 
			I am jointly supervised by <a href="https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~georgios/">Georgios Piliouras</a> and <a href="https://shaoweilin.github.io/">Shaowei Lin</a>.
			Prior to this, I graduated from <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a> in 2014 after pursuing my bachelor's degree in pure mathematics.
			Subsequently, I worked as a lecturer at <a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/">Temasek Polytechnic</a>, where I taught subjects related to mathematics and statistics.
			I am currently looking for positions that lies within my research interests, which are stated as follows:

		<h3>Research Interests</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain applications - Formal verification of blockchain</li>
			<li><strong>Theorem Prover:</strong> Formalization and verification of mathematics, programs and protocols - Automated reasoning tools on proof assistants</li>
			<li><strong>Others:</strong> Mathematical logic - Type theory - Category theory - Program synthesis - Artificial intelligence</li>
		</ul>
