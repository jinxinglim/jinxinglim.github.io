		<p>
		    Hi! I am a <strong>Software Engineer at <a href="https://pi2.network/">Pi Squared Inc.</a></strong>, 
		    currently building <strong><a href="https://omniset.fastset.xyz/">Omniset</a></strong>, 
		    a high-performance universal settlement layer for sub-second finality.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		    Previously, I was the Tech Lead for key infrastructure projects at the company:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        <strong>Math Proof Generation (MPG):</strong> 
		        I led the team building components to generate machine-checkable proofs of program executions, 
		        ensuring computational integrity through formal verification.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <strong>Verifiable Settlement Layer (VSL):</strong> 
		        I headed the integration of VSL with AI clients and service providers, enabling fast, 
		        verifiable payments and settlements between heterogeneous agents.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Before joining Pi Squared, I worked as a formal verification engineer at Runtime Verification Inc. (2022-2024), 
			where I developed and contributed to several security testing and formal verification tools, 
			including <a href="https://ercx.runtimeverification.com/">ERCx</a> and <a href="https://kontrol.runtimeverification.com/">Kontrol</a>. 
			I also lectured on mathematics and statistics at <a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/">Temasek Polytechnic</a> (2014-2018).
		</p>

		<p>
			As for my education, I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> (2014) and 
			a Ph.D. in Engineering Systems and Design from the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design</a> (2022).
		</p>
		
		<h3>Research Interests</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain applications - Formal verification of blockchain</li>
			<li><strong>Theorem Prover:</strong> Formalization and verification of mathematics, programs and protocols - Automated reasoning tools on proof assistants</li>
			<li><strong>Others:</strong> Mathematical logic - Type theory - Category theory - Program synthesis - Artificial intelligence</li>
		</ul>
