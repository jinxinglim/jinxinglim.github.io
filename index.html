		<p>
			Hi! I am a software engineer at <a href="https://pi2.network/">Pi Squared Inc.</a>. I am also the team lead of the Math Proof Generation (MPG) team, 
			where we focus on building components that produce machine-checkable proofs of program executions.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Before joining Pi Squared, I worked as a formal verification engineer at Runtime Verification Inc. (2022-2024), 
			where I developed and contributed to several security testing and formal verification tools, 
			including <a href="https://ercx.runtimeverification.com/">ERCx</a> and <a href="https://kontrol.runtimeverification.com/">Kontrol</a>. 
			I also lectured on mathematics and statistics at <a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/">Temasek Polytechnic</a> (2014-2018).
		</p>

		<p>
			As for my education, I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> (2014) and 
			a Ph.D. in Engineering Systems and Design from the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design</a> (2022).
