			Hi! I am a formal verification engineer at <a href="https://runtimeverification.com/">Runtime Verification Inc</a>, where I develop
			software tools to detect security issues on smart contracts, particularly in the Ethereum ecosystem.
			Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics (2014) from the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> and 
			Ph.D. in Engineering Systems and Design (2022) from the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design</a>.
			My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Incentivized Mechanism Design for Collaborative Proofs and Programs through Blockchain and Theorem Provers", 
			where I worked on game theoretical analysis, interactive theorem proving and blockchain applications.
			I also worked as a lecturer (2014 - 2018) at <a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/">Temasek Polytechnic</a>, where I taught subjects 
			related to mathematics and statistics. My research interests lie within the following domains:

		<h3>Research Interests</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain applications - Formal verification of blockchain</li>
			<li><strong>Theorem Prover:</strong> Formalization and verification of mathematics, programs and protocols - Automated reasoning tools on proof assistants</li>
			<li><strong>Others:</strong> Mathematical logic - Type theory - Category theory - Program synthesis - Artificial intelligence</li>
		</ul>
